      <p class="about-description">
          I have always been tech savy. Growing up I spent alot of time building computers with my father as a hobby. We would connect 4-5 together on a LAN connection and play alot of the classic computer games many know of. This sparked a constant interest in how things work and how websites, apps, and games are really created. As a junior developer at Northwestern University I hope to continue to grow and find a company that challenges me but also continues to develope my skills as a developer.
